    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Ofada rice is a Yoruba dish. It is the name of an indigenous rice from a small community called Ofada, <br> 
        located in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. It is not exclusively grown in the community, <br> 
        but it is an indigenous rice grown in southwest Nigeria but named after the Ofada community.It is used in making <br>
        a variety of dishes. Ofada rice are mostly blends, and some of the rice varieties in the blends are not indigenous <br>
        to Africa; however, they usually also contain African rice. It is grown almost exclusively in Ogun State, a state <br>
        in southwestern Nigeria. Ofada rice is grown on free-draining soil where the water table is permanently below <br>
        the root of the plant.

            <li>While the pepper is boiling, cover the pot and bleach the palm oil for 8-10mins. <br>
                Turn off the heat and leave the pot covered till the body is warm.</li>
            <li>Once the pot has cooled, put it back on the heat and add chopped onions. <br>
                Let it fry till it softens, and then add the iru and let both fry until a bubble of palm oil comes up.</li>
            <li>Add the meats stir and let it fry till the oil comes up.</li>
